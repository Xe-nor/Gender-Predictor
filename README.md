# Gender Predicting ML Model with Flask

Welcome to the README page for our gender predicting ML model created using Flask!

A ML model to predict the gender of a person based on certain features. The model was built using Python and various machine learning libraries, and is deployed using Flask, a popular web framework for Python.

## Built With

This model was built using Python and various machine learning libraries, including scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy. The model is deployed using Flask, a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python that allows us to create a RESTful API for our model.

## Features

- Accurate predictions of gender based on certain features
- Easy-to-use interface with intuitive controls

## Usage

To use the model, simply send a POST request to the API with the input features as a JSON object. The API will then return a JSON response with the predicted gender for that input.
